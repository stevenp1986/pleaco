        This API is a beta version of Handy API version 3 (v3) and may change over time.

        The core functionality is considered stable, and we strive to make any future changes backward compatible. Feedback, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome.

        Handy API v3 provides an HTTP interface for interacting with devices and is a complete rewrite of the previous version.

        For more detailed information about the API, concepts, use and code samples, see the <a href="https://links.handyfeeling.com/docs-api-handy-rest-v3">Handy API v3 documentation</a>.

        ## Unsupported firmware versions

        Devices with firmware older than version 4 (v4) must be updated to v4 before they can be controlled using API v3.

        See <a href="https://links.handyfeeling.com/docs-api-handy-rest-v3-fw3">Handling older firmware</a> for how to deal with devices with older firmware versions using this API.

        ## What's new?

        ### Authentication

        Unlike version 2 (v2), version 3 requires authentication for all device operations. This means that you need to have a registered account to use the API.

        You can register an account at the <a href="https://user.handyfeeling.com">Handyfeeling User web</a> and read more about <a href="https://links.handyfeeling.com/docs-api-handy-rest-v3-auth">authentication</a> in the Handy API v3 documentation.

        ### New protocols

        Version 3 offers additional protocols for controlling the device. These are:

        - <a href="https://links.handyfeeling.com/docs-api-handy-rest-v3-hvp">Handy Vibration Protocol (HVP)</a>
        - <a href="https://links.handyfeeling.com/docs-api-handy-rest-v3-hsp">Handy Streaming Protocol (HSP)</a>
        - <a href="https://links.handyfeeling.com/docs-api-handy-rest-v3-stream">Handy Stream Protocol (STREAM)</a>

        The new protocols enables control of new device models with new capabilities, and offer a more flexible and powerful way to control existing device models.

        ### SSE events

        Version 3 offers SSE (Server-Sent-Events) events. This allows you to subscribe to device events, avoiding the need to poll the device for state updates.

        ## Breaking changes

        The existing v2 protocols are still supported. There are changes to the request and response formats so existing v2 users will need to migrate to handle these changes.

        Functionally, the protocols are more or less the same with a few caveats. HSSP specifically does no longer support setup of scripts hosted on private networks.

        If you need an alternative script host, consider the [Hosting API](https://handyfeeling.com/api/hosting/v2/docs/) for temporary hosting of scripts.

        See the protocol documentation for details:

        - <a href="https://links.handyfeeling.com/docs-api-handy-rest-v3-hdsp">Handy Direct Streaming Protocol (HDSP)</a>
        - <a href="https://links.handyfeeling.com/docs-api-handy-rest-v3-hssp">Handy Synchronized Script Protocol (HSSP)</a>

It's an alternativ to the ApplicationID that should be harder to abuse outside your application's browser environment.\n\nA token is valid for a limited time, after which it expires. The default lifetime for a token is 1 hour. You can adjust this lifespan up to a maximum of 24 hours using the `ttl` parameter.\n\nA token can be configured with the following optional restrictions:\n- Device connection key\n- Client IP\n- Client Origin\n- Client Referer\n- Client User-Agent\n- Client Accept-Language\n- Client Accept-Encoding\n- Client Cache-Control\n\nSpecifying a device connection key ensures that the token can only be used with a specific device.\n\nThe client values forms a lightweight client fingerprint that makes it harder to abuse the token outside the client environment.\n\n**NOTE**: Issuing a client-token for a specific device does not eliminate the need to include the connection key when sending device commands.\n\nThe `X-Connection-Key` header is still required for device-specific operations, even if the client-token was issued for that device.\n        \n### Token Renewal\n\nAlongside the token, you receive a **renew** URL. Use this URL to extend your token's validity, ensuring uninterrupted service for long-running applications.\n\nThe renew URL remains valid as long as the token is valid. Remember to renew before the token expires; post-expiration, both the token and renew URL become invalid, necessitating a new token issue.\n\nThe renew operation only extends the token's lifespan. It does not alter initial restrictions (device connection key or other client values) set during token issuance.\n"

                Starts a Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream for real-time updates on device events.

                It's an efficient way to receive continuous updates on device connectivity, mode changes, and other relevant events without the need to poll API endpoints.

                To reveive events for a single device, specify the device connection key with the `ck` query parameter.

                To receive events for multiple devices, a channel reference can be specified with the `ck` query parameter. This will receive events from all channel subcribers.

                Optionally filter events by specifying the `events` query parameter. If not specified, all events are pushed to the client.

                Ex. events=device_connected,device_disconnected


                **NOTE1:**The Swagger UI does not support SSE, so you can not directly test the endpoint from this page. The endpoint works with any SSE-compatible client, such as a browser or a dedicated SSE client.


                **NOTE2:**The endpoint requires authentication. Since SSE does not support headers, the credentials must be passed as a query parameter (apikey). You can use an ApplicationID or an issued client token as the apikey value.


                This Handy v3 OpenAPI specification defines schema definitions for each event type. If you use a code generation tool that generates schemas, you should be able to use these types when parsing the SSE stream events.


                The SSE stream provides the following events:

                - `battery_changed` Received when the battery status have changed.

                - `ble_status_changed` Received when the BLE status have changed.

                - `button_event` Received in case of an unhandled button event. Eg. the user uses a device button in a way ignored by the current device mode.

                - `device_clock_synchronized` Received when the device clock have finished synchronization with the server clock.

                - `device_connected` Received when the device connects.

                - `device_disconnected` Received when the device disconnects.

                - `device_error` Received when a device error occurs.

                - `device_status` Received when starting the SSE connection.

                - `hamp_state_changed` Received when the HAMP state have changed.

                - `hrpp_state_changed` Received when the HRPP state have changed.

                - `hdsp_state_changed` Received when the HDSP state have changed.

                - `hsp_looping` Received when the HSP starts a new loop.

                - `hsp_starving` Received when the HSP is starving (no more data to play). Only sent if pause_on_starving is disabled.

                - `hsp_state_changed` Received when the HSP state have changed.

                - `hsp_threshold_reached` Received when the HSP data threshold is reached.

                - `hsp_paused_on_starving` Received when the HSP is paused due to starvation. Only sent if pause_on_starving is enabled.

                - `hsp_resumed_on_not_starving` Received when the HSP is resumed after starvation and playable data is available. Only sent if pause_on_starving is enabled.

                - `stream_end_reached` Received when the end of a closed stream have been reached. This includes scripts played with the HSSP protocol or closed streams played with STREAM protocol.

                - `hvp_state_changed` Received when the HVP state changes.

                - `low_memory_error` Received when the device failed to handle some command due to memory limitations.

                - `low_memory_warning` Received when the device's available free memory is critically low.

                - `mode_changed` Received when the device mode have changed.

                - `ota_progress` Received when the OTA progress have changed.

                - `slider_blocked` Received when the slider is blocked.

                - `slider_unblocked` Received when the slider is unblocked.

                - `stroke_changed` Received when the stroke region have changed.

                - `temp_high` Received when the device temperature is high.

                - `temp_ok` Received when the device temperature is back to normal.

                - `wifi_scan_complete` Received when a device wifi scan have completed.

                - `wifi_status_changed` Received when the wifi status have changed.

                This endpoint provides the current server time, necessary for calculating the client-server offset (cs_offset). This offset is crucial for estimating the server time on the client side (Tcest).

                **Calculating Client-Server Offset (cs_offset)**

                1. **Sample Collection**: Obtain N samples of server time (Ts) from the endpoint. More samples improve accuracy but increase estimation time. A good starting point is 30 samples.
                2. **Round-Trip Delay (RTD) Measurement**: For each sample, record the send time (Tsend) and receive time (Treceive). Calculate RTD as Treceive - Tsend.
                3. **Server Time Estimation (Ts_est)**: Estimate the server time at response receipt by adding half of the RTD to the server time (Ts). Formula: Ts_est = Ts + RTD/2.
                4. **Offset Calculation**: Determine the offset between Ts_est and client time (Tc) at response receipt. Since Tc equals Treceive, the offset is Ts_est - Treceive.
                5. **Aggregate Offset Update**: Update the aggregated offset value (offset_agg) by adding the new offset. Formula: offset_agg = offset_agg + offset.
                6. **Average Offset (cs_offset)**: After all samples are processed, calculate the average offset by dividing offset_agg by the number of samples (X). Formula: cs_offset = offset_agg / X.

                This method provides a reliable estimate of the client-server offset (cs_offset).

                Typically, cs_offset is calculated once and used for future Tcest calculations. However, if synchronization issues arise (due to network changes, clock drift, etc.), recalculating cs_offset may be beneficial.

                **Calculating Client-Side Estimated Server Time (Tcest)**

                The Tcest value, required for certain API endpoints (e.g., /hssp/play), is calculated as follows:

                Tcest = Tc + cs_offset

                where Tc is the current client time and cs_offset is the pre-calculated client-server offset.

            description: |
                Setup initializes a new HSP session on the device. This ensures both the device and server are properly prepared, clearing any existing HSP session state.

                If the device is already in an HSP session and no setup command is issued, all HSP commands will modify the existing session, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

                The `stream_id` is an optional session identifier. If it changes during a HSP session, it indicates that a new session has been initiated by a client. If no `stream_id` is provided, one will be generated and returned in the setup response.

                You can add up to 100 points to the device's point buffer in a single command.

                If the buffer is full, adding N points will remove the first N points to make room for the new ones.

                The `flush` flag can be used to remove all existing points from the buffer before adding the new points.

                The `tail_point_threshold` parameter can be used to update the tail point stream index threshold after the points have been added.
